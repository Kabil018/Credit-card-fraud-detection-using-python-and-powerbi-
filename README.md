# Credit Card Fraud Detection & Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions to identify suspicious activities and potential fraud patterns. It combines **Python (Colab)** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis, with **Power BI** for building an interactive dashboard to visualize fraud insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **credit_card_transactions.csv** – Dataset used for analysis  
- **notebook.ipynb** – Google Colab notebook for preprocessing and analysis in Python  
- **Fraud_Dashboard.pbix** – Power BI dashboard file  
- **README.md** – Project description

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 🔹 Python (Colab)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, formatting, encoding)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering for fraud flags (e.g., high-value transactions, unusual merchants)  
- Exported cleaned dataset for Power BI visualization  

### 🔹 Power BI
- Built a dashboard named **"Credit Card Fraud Analysis Dashboard"**  
- Key KPIs:
  - **Total Transactions**
  - **Total Fraud Cases**
  - **% Fraud Transactions**
  - **Average Transaction Value**
  - **High-Value Fraud Count**
- Visualizations:
  - **Scatter Plot:** High-Value Transactions (colored by Fraud flag)  
  - **Table:** Customer-level suspicious activity  
  - **Cards:** Quick KPIs for fraud metrics  
  - **Filters:** Transaction type, merchant, and region

## 📊 Insights
- Identified **patterns in high-value fraud transactions**  
- Highlighted **customers with unusually high fraud counts**  
- Pinpointed **suspicious merchants** linked with multiple fraudulent cases
